# Tips for Organizational Change

2023 is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first Software Carpentry workshop
at Los Alamos National Laboratory [Wilson2016].
A lot has changed in those years:
open access journals (like this one) have proven that they can work,
most scientific research is powered (at least in part) by open source software,
there is greater awareness and discussion of equity and inclusivity shortcomings,
and researchers can connect with each other online in ways that only a few visionaries dreamed of.

But a lot of things haven't changed or have gotten worse:

-   A handful of large publishing companies continue to extract exorbitant rents
    for "allowing" us to read our own work.

-   Most researchers are no more computationally competent than they were in the 1990s,
    which means that most research is no more reproducible than it was then.

-   Academic life is increasingly arduous, insecure, and under-funded,
    and "awareness" and "discussion" are only rarely translated into effective action.

-   The tools that have allowed researchers to share ideas
    have also helped foster and spread anti-scientific disinformation on the climate crisis,
    vaccines,
    and hundreds of other topics,
    leading directly to the loss of millions of lives.

Throughout the last quarter of a century,
advocates of truth, openness, and fairness have acted as if being right was enough to guarantee victory.
However, "If you build it, they will come" has never been a winning strategy.
Systemic change always starts with
a small group of idealists sharing ideas and building a core constituency,
but only has impact when people take on the hard work of organizing in the large.
From women's rights to the struggle for racial equality and the gay rights movement,
every significant step towards a fairer society
has required people to challenge authority in numbers too great to be ignored
[Beckerman2022, Hirshman2012, Ricks2022, Wagner2019].

This paper presents *N* short tips for doing this
drawn from the authors' experience and from works such as [Alinsky1989, Brown2007, Manns2015].
We recognize that it is incomplete—in particular,
that it is stronly biased toward what works in affluent, democratic societies—but
we hope it will be a useful starting point for those who are tired of rolling heavy rocks up steep hills over and over again.

## 1) Be sure this is where you want to focus your efforts.

It's going to take years,
it could well fail,
and there are many other things you could do,
so be sure this particular change is the one you want to fight for.

## 2)  Ask those who will be affected.

*Nihil pro nobis sine nobis* (nothing for us, without us) is always a good motto,
and asking for opinions often reveals potential allies.

## 3)  Be specific.

Few people would argue in public against fair hiring practices,
but the organization has to implement something specific in order for that to mean anything,
and people very well might argue against those specifics.
You should therefore pick something specific and achievable
and make a concrete plan for achieving it.
And start with whatever is likely to have broadest support,
because success breeds success.

## 4)  Figure out who actually has the power to make that change and what they actually care about.

Your neighbors don't make policy for your local public school:
school board trustees do, so that's who you need to influence.
Help someone who wants the same change as you get elected,
or help someone who doesn't oppose your change with something they care about in exchange for support for your cause,
but whatever you do, do it for the people whose vote counts.
Conversely, figure out who is going to be negatively impacted by the change you want
and what you can do to help them:
for example,
if it's going to eliminate jobs,
what else can those people usefully do?

## 5)  Build alliances

"I'll help you if you'll help me" makes the world go around.
It's hard when people want the same thing for very different reasons,
but this rule is *not* cynical:
people whose beliefs are aligned may still have different priorities.
(The flip side of this rule is to accept that some people will never be your allies:
if everyone wanted it, you wouldn't have to push for the change.)
People who want the same thing you do,
who have a high profile (either inside your group or externally),
or who have a wide range of connections are all useful allies.

## 6)  Test the waters.

At every stage, refine your idea and presentation in front of a small group first.
But remember:
when done honestly,
"refining your idea" sometimes means accepting that you wanted the wrong thing.
And note that it can be useful to ask someone to be the official skeptic:
giving them a way to critique in private may temper their public criticism,
and you just might convert them.

## 7)  Keep it visible.

It's easy to start a blog and create a Mastodon account,
but that very ease has reduced these channels' impact.
Is there a newsletter you can be included in (which makes you look more official)?
Can you make a presentation as part of some other event (rather than organizing a gathering of your own)?
Can you get someone with a higher profile to mention what you're doing and point people your way?
Can you post notices in the lunchroom? The elevator? The washrooms? Local restaurants?
Some people will do things for t-shirts and stickers that they won't do for money...
And always share a single point of contact that someone actually checks (frequently).

## 8)  Collect data but tell stories.

Sooner or later someone is going to ask what financial impact this change is going to have,
so be ready for that.
Data about other changes or from other organizations helps a lot,
but data doesn't have nearly as powerful an impact as stories.
Don't explain what *kind* of people this will help:
explain how it helped a specific person,
or how it would make a specific person's life better.
And if you've never cried when telling that story,
tell a better story.

## 9)  Learn how to run meetings and make decisions.

You can get the change you want without being a great public speaker,
but you *must* know how to run a meeting and make decisions.

## 10) Celebrate when you can, grieve when you need to.

Burnout is an occupational hazard for everyone trying to make meaningful change,
in part because we get so used to doing things on our own at the start
that we don't share the load even when there are people to share it with.
Not all of your allies will become your friends,
but those who do will be able to share your victories
and commiserate with your defeats like no one else.
